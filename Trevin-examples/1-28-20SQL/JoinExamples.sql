--------JOIN EXAMPLES!!!!
SELECT * FROM album;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM album;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM artist;

-------------INNER JOIN
SELECT * FROM artist a INNER JOIN album b ON a.artistid= b.artistid;
---let's do a count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM artist a INNER JOIN album b ON a.artistid= b.artistid;
--old way of doing an inner join
SELECT * FROM artist a, album b WHERE a.artistid=b.artistid;

-----------LEFT OUTER JOIN
SELECT * FROM artist a LEFT OUTER JOIN album b ON a.artistid= b.artistid;
---let's do a count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM artist a LEFT OUTER JOIN album b ON a.artistid= b.artistid;
--old way of doing a left outer join
SELECT * FROM artist a, album b WHERE a.artistid=b.artistid(+);

--------RIGHT OUTER JOIN
SELECT * FROM artist a RIGHT OUTER JOIN album b ON a.artistid=b.artistid;
---let's do a count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM artist a RIGHT OUTER JOIN album b ON a.artistid= b.artistid;
--old way of doing a right outer join
SELECT * FROM artist a, album b WHERE a.artistid(+)=b.artistid;

------FULL OUTER JOIN
SELECT a.name, b.title AS BTitle FROM artist a FULL OUTER JOIN album b ON a.artistid=b.artistid;
SELECT a.name, b.title AS BTitle FROM artist a FULL JOIN album b ON a.artistid=b.artistid;
--let's do a count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM artist a FULL OUTER JOIN album b ON a.artistid=b.artistid;
----

----joins do NOT have to be joined on keys, they CAN be non-key fields

---LEFT without middle of vendiagram,
----(exclusive left join, aka distinct left join, aka strictly left join)
SELECT * FROM artist a LEFT OUTER JOIN album b ON a.artistid=b.artistid
    WHERE a.artistid NOT IN(
        SELECT c.artistid FROM artist c INNER JOIN album d ON c.artistid=d.artistid
    );
---ANOTHER WAY to do the same exact thing
SELECT * FROM  artist a LEFT OUTER JOIN album b ON a.artistid=b.artistid
    WHERE b.artistid IS NULL;

----EXCLUSIVE FULL JOIN
SELECT * FROM artist a FULL OUTER JOIN album b ON a.artistid=b.artistid
    WHERE b.artistid IS NULL OR a.artistid IS NULL;


--SELF JOIN
---SELECT * FROM table01 a INNER JOIN table01 b ON a.id=b.foreignid;

---CROSS JOIN aka CARTESIAN JOIN
-----SELECT * FROM table01 CROSS JOIN table02;
