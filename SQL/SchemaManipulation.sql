/* DATATYPES in oracle sql:
    NUMBER, VARCHAR, VARCHAR2, DATE, TIMESTAMP, BLOB, CLOB, and more

CONSTRAINTS: they are restrictions on data that can be entered into a column.
    NOT NULL - ensures the record has a value in this column
    UNIQUE - ensures that any two will not have the same value for this column
    PRIMARY KEY - it represents the official identifier for the record
        --- PK is a combination of UNIQUE and NOT NULL
    FOREIGN KEY - is a reference pointer to another table's record
    
    ---example syntax for PK: PRIMARY KEY (refKey from THIS table)
    ---example syntax for FK: FOREIGN KEY ( refernce_attribute from this_table)
                                REFERENCES other_table(PK_from_other_table)

    CHECK - creates an additional custom condition for the column
    ----example syntax: CONSTRAINT constraint_name CHECK (column_name > 15);
    (some databases have DEFAULT constraint)

/* not going to do an example BUT truncate deletes all entries into a table 
while keeping the table structure intact. DROP is like throwing a cup of water
into the trash, while TRUNCATE is like pouring out the water while keeping the cup
(deletes all rows, saves the columns)
